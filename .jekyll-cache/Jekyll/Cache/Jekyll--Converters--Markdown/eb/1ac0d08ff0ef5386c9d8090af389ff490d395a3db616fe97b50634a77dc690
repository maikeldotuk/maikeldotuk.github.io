I"{<p>For my job as office admin I was using my Macbook white. That is a laptop from 2009 that I bought a few months ago simply to have a macOS platform to test applications on my phone. You canâ€™t program for Apple without their OS, and hence their computers. It cost me barely 125 pounds that computer and i upgraded it by putting on it a SSD drive. I barely used it though.</p>
