<p>I am working, I am not working, I am not sure‚Ä¶.<strong>that isn‚Äôt good.</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically I have a 21 to 24 hours per week job as an administrative support to someone with a dissability. But I have no idea what are the hours that I will be officially working, I have very little idea of when am I paid. I haven‚Äôt even signed a contract. Yet I‚Äôm already counting hours in a time-sheet.</p>

<p>I need some clarity but I can‚Äôt have it until I‚Äôve done the 3 parts of this job. It seems to involve three locations, one is one of the London borough‚Äôs Town Hall. From there I would do admin duties. Such as proof-reading text that could be too much hassle for my boss, because I am not physically restricted.</p>

<p>The right description would be a support worker for admin duties. I just do office kind of work and payroll.</p>

<p>The second location is elsewhere and there I would do payroll tasks as I would be officially working for a payroll company.<br />
The third location is his home as that‚Äôs where he has the rest of the paperwork that requires doing. Also some IT tasks and the redoing of the company website, leaflets would be mine.</p>

<p>It all sounds good described but I want it written on paper. Also the 21 to 24 hours have been only verbally guaranteed for 2 months. That‚Äôs not enough, not even close. I need a written formal contract stating when will the hours be reduced and what is my working pattern. My rent needs to be paid every month after all, I need to be prepared. I can‚Äôt be prepared without a date.</p>

<h3 id="the-other-ones">The other ones</h3>

<p>Are one I did yesterday as Meter Reader for A company, and today the same exact job for B company. Two interviews, same job, conditions and client of the agencies.</p>

<p>They both have no idea I‚Äôm applying for them both but, as I said, I am on a first-come first-served basis. I need a guaranteed job now. Not whenever suits them. The quicker one gets the comission.</p>

<p>Then there are two more. The Aircraft Cleaner job that is so far doing the paperwork (checking references), while the School Caretaker job is not even bothering replying my follow-up emails. In this case I am not going to hide the name, is Tempest Resourcing. They are a dreadful agency that made me go all the way to central London with all my paperwork just to send me back home and fill up my mail inbox of SPAM for other vacancies and DBS checks that I do not have to pay for. Bad recruiters.</p>

<p>My personal choice would be the admin role. Solely based in the transferable skills it is by far the best. But it doesn‚Äôt offer any stability and the job so far, it is 21 hours per week yet this week I am already doing less than that. When does the 21 hours per week start?</p>

<p>The meter reader ones have no transferable skills, it‚Äôs basically a dead-end job that pays the bill but doesn‚Äôt improve a CV.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve pushed today for a written contract. Hopefully I‚Äôll get it, I rather be optimistic.</p>

<p>On the other side, I got a house to clean every week for 40 pounds (3 hours at 12 pounds and hour + tube fare). It is for someone I know well, my ex-roomate when I used to live in Central London. So‚Ä¶that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve got guaranteed every week.</p>

<p>I honestly want to stop jobseeking immediately. I‚Äôve got a lot to do university-wise.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve got to see a proffesional contact. My friend N (let‚Äôs leave it as ‚ÄòN‚Äô) has introduced me in the hope that he could tell me about any leads in my industry.</p>

<p>Clearly N has no idea how my industry works. Every industry has a component of ‚Äúwho you know‚Äù, some of them have a stronger component of ‚Äúwhat you know‚Äù. If you‚Äôve got serious programming skills you don‚Äôt need to know anyone, recruiters will fight to get you a job.</p>

<p>I lack <strong>senior</strong> programming skills and in London there‚Äôs no such thing as entry-level programming jobs. That is why I‚Äôm unemployable in the IT sector.</p>

<p>N doesn‚Äôt realise of that and persists in that it is my fault not having an IT job already. Like if I could move a magic wand, meet the right people and change the way the job market works in London.</p>

<p>Anyway, regarding the proffesional contact, he seems interesting enough to meet him even when there‚Äôs no job attached behind that meeting.</p>
