I"0<p>This is the post with all the content running up to TMA02.</p>

<p>Well, I’ve created, edited, finished the TMA and sent it. What is new that was included is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added the Volere template as requested by the tutor.</li>
  <li>Described the stages of software development as requested.</li>
  <li>Amended the schedule, I now have to finish the entire thing before middle of July.</li>
</ul>

<p>This TMA has been less work than the one before but that doesn’t matter, is the project what takes time not the TMAs. I need too free-up tie.</p>
