I",
<p>Today I had an interview, as I mentioned I won’t say ever details of companies here because this is my blog and as such I can decide what to post about my life but other people deserve their privacy, including companies.</p>

<p>I had this interviewer (picture below) who sent me this email after I applied for two vacancies they had advertised in their website, one is receptionist the other one is shift manager.</p>

<p>After taking the time to prepare for the interview, paying the tube fare (which is <strong>not cheap</strong>) to go there, I discovered that there are no vacancies for either receptionist, nor shift manager. Only for full-time cleaner 4pm to midnight Monday to Friday for 8 pounds an hour. The email, as you clearly see, says the opposite.</p>

<p>Last Thursday I had another one for a full-time caretaker job in Acton, as soon as I was in the interview I was offered to start immediately. Full time job, 9.75 pounds an hour. Here comes the magic part: <strong>the contract is for just one week.</strong> Yep, that literally means I would have started this Monday, finished this Friday, just to cover someone’s lack of organisation with someone else’s holidays and that’s it. No security, no full-time employment, nothing.</p>

<p>Interview, last Friday. Popular place of Mexican food in Park Royal (that’s as far as I’d go without naming them). Offered full-time employment over the phone. Salary negotiable. Went to the interview, pay is 7.50 per hour…hours aren’t set on stone, always evenings “until there are no more customers”….zero hours contract basically. How on Earth do I sign a contract for a flat with that lack of job security, let alone that kind of wage ?</p>

<p>Today on the early morning, I had a Resourcerer calling me in regards of a vacancy, I won’t hide the name of the company on this occasion. Here is the <a href="https://www.cv-library.co.uk/job/207352593/Screen-Print-Assistants">link</a> to the vacancy.</p>

<p>She just calls me to tell me that <strong>I am too far from Hayes</strong>. This image shows how far I am from Hayes.</p>

<p>Clearly she failed Geography during her A-levels.</p>

<p><strong>This is what London’s job market has become.</strong></p>
