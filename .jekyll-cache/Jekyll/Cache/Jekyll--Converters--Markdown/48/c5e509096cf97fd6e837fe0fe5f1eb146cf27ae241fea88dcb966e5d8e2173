<p>Iâ€™ve started by creating a git init for the backend as I didnâ€™t notice I didnâ€™t have it version controlled.</p>

<p>But now that is finished and Iâ€™m going to refactor the whole thing and clean it up for the TMA it must be version controlled.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t only refactored but I have also added documentation of the entire API. Using a tool called apidocs which was incredibly easy to learn. I will use it again for my own site in www.maikel.uk</p>

<p>Now the backend is finished and deployed in</p>

<p>The result is in the image above this post which I will probably use for TMA02. Which Iâ€™m going to start writing now.</p>

<p>It took me just 3 hours to get all the documentation written and the backend deployed on my website.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Apache configuration, Iâ€™ve changed it manually, this should be reflected on the site. This means the AMI needs re-doing.</li>
  <li>The environment variables need to be declared. Check serverconf.json</li>
  <li>The file serverconf.json needs to be created, it has private keys and the salt for the tokens, is either that or download it with the AMI.</li>
</ol>
