<p>On Tuesday my phone rang three times. All of them were work related</p>

<ul>
  <li>First: Recruiter about a job as a caretaker. She said ‚Äúbut you‚Äôve been working in something else for a long time, can you describe me your tasks as a caretaker‚Äù and I told her my entire day routine. She didn‚Äôt seem interested, she had already made her (narrow) with what she said. <strong>How on Earth can anyone forget the tasks of a caretaker,</strong> specially considering they aren‚Äôt rocket science and require absolutely no special qualities, is a mystery to me. So‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think is my lost, I rather work with recruiters who know the jobs they are offering.</li>
  <li>Second: A very nice very kind lady about a job fixing little devices very close to home, as a supply chain administrator. She asked for an interview the next day.</li>
  <li>Third: A scam, a guy representing a company that a month ago didn‚Äôt exist called <a href="https://ecmteamfive.info">Ecmteamfive</a> and I know it doesn‚Äôt exist because I put the company code on Companies House and <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11106080/filing-history">as you can see</a> they have been in existence barely a month. To add more to the scam the interview was being held in 40 Liverpool Street, that‚Äôs the address of a hotel. To me this is clearly the scam of Amway, Herbalife or the guaranteed job after a <strong>paid</strong> course. As the offer was as administrator I guess that some sort of Sage accountancy course.</li>
</ul>

<p>During and after those calls I kept applying, in fact I‚Äôve barely done anything else this week than waking up and to keep applying until I went to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="so-on-wednesday">So on Wednesday</h3>

<p>I went to the interview with the very nice lady. Her office was really cozy but strangely she did all the talking. You normally go to an interview to be‚Ä¶.interviewed. In this occasion I was told the entire life-story of the company (her client) she wanted to send me. Like, to be sure I would like the job. I didn‚Äôt quite understand what was happening. It was a really nice interview by the fact that I just had to sit and listen. But I felt I was left with more questions than answers that day. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why are you considering me?</li>
  <li>When did I apply for this job (I didn‚Äôt).</li>
  <li>Why are you selling me the company as if I were not desperate to work for them?</li>
  <li>Why are you not asking me questions at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>According to that very nice lady, next week I‚Äôll get a second interview and after that by Friday the answer to whether I am successful or not. There are 3 other candidates and the company hiring requires someone starting by Monday the 12th of February.</p>

<h3 id="whats-news">What‚Äôs news?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lsst.ac/">London School of Science and Technology</a> interviewed me four weeks ago for a role as Registry Assistant. After me taking the time to go there and the effort of preparing for the interview they have not even bothered to send a canned ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù email as response.</p>

<p>The restaurant I was going to work as Assistant Accountant, for which I took the time and effort of learning quickly how to work with <a href="https://www.xero.com/uk/try/accounting-software/?gclid=CjwKCAiAtdDTBRArEiwAPT4y-1jp4KnDyfkp7vXTa44dCaXSxui3TsrzcP_dg-MarfvkWFD0YaQPExoCflYQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CIDAmoO6iNkCFdA8Gwod15kJOA">Xero accounting</a> software, is now not hiring.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve lowered my standards on applications to the lowest possible and I‚Äôm still unemployed.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt know what else to do.</p>
