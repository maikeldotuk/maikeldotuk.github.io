<p>I’m worried about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Money</li>
  <li>University</li>
  <li>Future</li>
  <li>Health</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably the most important one is future but the ones that are more pressing, or, in other words, the ones I worry more are work and university.</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-work">Let’s talk about work</h2>

<p>So, I’m working for a company as a Junior Software Engineer. I feel the shoes of even “junior” are way too big for me to fit on them. Probably “trainee” would have been better.</p>

<p>I’ve got to develop a project that initially seemed small, using the M.E.A.N stack (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node). The pressure comes from multiple sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The pressure on everybody waiting for me to deliver the code.</li>
  <li><strong>The feeling my job is 100% unstable and I could be sack any day.</strong></li>
  <li>The fact I’ve got to make up specifications and requirements as I go along, most of the coding is based on guesses of what is required. I don’t feel comfortable making those decisions on a commercial setting.</li>
  <li>The fact I’ve got almost 0 experience in a commercial setting as a programmer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one I put in bold is the most concerning one and it has an impact on money. So…</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-money">Let’s talk about money</h2>

<p>I should have never moved flat. Let me rephrase that, I should have never moved to the flat I moved. 775 pounds per month on top of which I’ve got to add more than 100 pounds in transport is just a very big chunk of my salary. It doesn’t give me enough room to even go out on a Friday. And more important I can’t barely save.</p>

<p>So the issues are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The rent I’m paying is ridiculously high.</li>
  <li>I can’t break the contract until it finishes on March 2019.</li>
  <li>I can’t save because of that rent.</li>
  <li>We’re in June which means I’ve got to still pay 9 months, this is 6975 pounds, before I’m free from this flat.</li>
  <li>I can’t save money.</li>
  <li>I barely make ends meet every month.</li>
  <li><strong>As I can’t save I can’t plan for the future.</strong></li>
  <li>As this ties me to my job I work more stressed, being over-zealous on doing my tasks to the utmost perfection. This leads me to errors I wouldn’t do if I wasn’t so financially dependent of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In bold is my biggest worry, which leads us to…</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-university">Let’s talk about university</h2>

<p>I did a disastrous exam for my last module apart from the project. If I get a grade 3 or grade 4 I’m still open to get a final degree mark of 2.1, anything less and my dreams are over.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exam final mark, which I won’t know until the 17th of July.</li>
  <li><strong>The project, I’ve barely have any time to dedicate to it.</strong></li>
  <li>The project uses the same tech as my job, which is an advantage but every time I’m working on is like being back at work.</li>
  <li>The complexity of the project keeps growing.</li>
  <li>I fear I might end up with less than a final degree 2.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Time, the usual problem that I have had in the past 5 years every time I’ve been studying and working at the same time. It is really hard to do both things. But time leads us to…</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-the-future">Let’s talk about the future</h2>

<p>It feels like the end of a cycle me being in Britain. I don’t know whether I want to stay to see how Brexit happens, whether I want to stay and get the British citizenship, whether I should leave. The thing is, I’m about to finish university, which is the only real thing tying me to this country. I would like to learn a third language and I always had a thing for Germany. On the other side I miss having a proper social life, I miss the sun. I’ve thought a lot about going back to Andorra because work-wise I’ve never felt better and circumstances are different now. I left because I wanted to study, that’s nearly finished. But…why Andorra when I could try my lack elsewhere. Life is short, I don’t want to waste it paying someone else’s retiring pot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It feels I’m wasting my time paying someone else’s retirement.</li>
  <li>I don’t feel I have a life, just worries.</li>
  <li>I don’t have joy, when I have fun I’m thinking “is it enough fun to get me through the week?”. That’s no way to have fun .</li>
  <li>I haven’t had proper holidays in years.</li>
  <li>I don’t want my live to be dictated by work.</li>
  <li>I don’t want to waste 2 hours every day commuting in the future.</li>
  <li>I don’t want my spare time to be dedicated to sleep to be able to be productive at work the next day.</li>
  <li>I don’t want to spend the weekends worried about resting enough to be productive the next week.</li>
  <li>I want to be a software engineer on my own terms.</li>
  <li>I want to be self-employed but properly.</li>
  <li>I don’t want my income to come from just one source and therefore depend on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just feel like a robot. Wake up, work, home, sleep, wake up, work, home, sleep,…repeat Monday through Friday then, wake up, try to maximise the fun, get depressed because I couldn’t, go to sleep, wake up, work, home, sleep. <strong>It’s an insane routine.</strong> Which leads us to…</p>

<h2 id="lets-not-talk-about-health">Let’s <strong>not</strong> talk about health.</h2>

<p>Because I have enough worries about everything else to put this one on top. I’ve been sick and at home for two days, I’m not recovered yet going back to work because I’ve got to pay someone’s retirement pot thanks to my tenancy agreement and I’m not paid when I’m sick.</p>

<p>There were 15 minutes today while I was at work that I was feeling so sick I had a panic attack. I just hid it and carried on trying my biggest effort to not fall from my chair, or vomit.</p>

<p>These is what my days have become. I lack freedom more than ever. The longer I live in London, the more I wonder if it’s worth trying to settle in the UK. Is like the donkey with the never reachable carrot on a stick. I don’t feel there’s social mobility in this country.</p>
