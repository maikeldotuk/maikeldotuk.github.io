I"Î<p>For my job as office admin I was using my Macbook white. That is a laptop from 2009 that I bought a few months ago simply to have a macOS platform to test applications on my phone. You canâ€™t program for Apple without their OS, and hence their computers. It cost me barely 125 pounds that computer and i upgraded it by putting on it a SSD drive. I barely used it though.</p>

<p>But with work I needed it so I used it. It was a dreadful experience, I felt inefficient and at times absolutely incompetent. So I thought, I need to get another laptop and I started searching in Amazon, one that I was really aiming for is this one.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/11/laptop.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reasons to go for that one are that it has all the components I want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>proper video card</li>
  <li>proper SSD drive (NVMe)</li>
  <li>8th Gen i5 processor</li>
  <li>8GB of RAM.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason to not decide for it is simple: <strong>price</strong>. Iâ€™m focused in saving enough money for 2 extra months of rent for peace of mind. Just in case my boss gets sick of me. So I didnâ€™t feel that growing my debt by 700 pounds was a wise choice.</p>

<p>So today I went all over different shops to find one that I could buy and wasnâ€™t an absolute disgrace of laptop and found this one I have. Itâ€™s model codename is exacty: A315-51-376T. You can find all the specs <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ZA/content/model/NX.GNPEA.001">here</a>. But in a nutshell:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>6th</strong> <strong>Gen</strong> i3 processor. Which means itâ€™ll be speedy enough and guarantees itâ€™ll have some USB 3 ports.</li>
  <li>4GB of RAM <strong>DDR4</strong>. Thatâ€™s insufficient but the fact it is DDR4 means I can upgrade it with spare RAM modules I have at home.</li>
  <li>1TB HDD. Too slow, but again, being a 6th gen Intel means it is <strong>SATA3</strong> which means I can replace it with any of my spares SSDs and make it 20 times faster.</li>
  <li><strong>Only 210 pounds.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The price was an excellent selling point. The fact it was so upgradeable made the next biggest selling point too. I donâ€™t think they (CEX) should have sold it for 210 pounds, this computer could be sold for at least 300 easily. Plus it looks brand new except for a few scratches in the back.</p>

<p>So once back home I have dedicated the evening to cloning Windows from its HDD to my SSD and then replace the hard drive for the SSD. Then added an 8GB DDR4 RAM module so now it has 12GB of RAM. And now is a very fast computer. I installed Adobe Ilustrator and Photoshop and they run pretty quick.</p>

<p>I might fall short in the size of the SSD, as it is just a 120GB drive but I might simply get a bigger one in the future. One of the things I like the most is the size of the screen, I despise 13 inches laptops, 15 inches is the right size. The speakers are excellent by the way and by far my favourite feature is how easily I could replace the hard drive and add RAM memory, because as you see in the picture below, itâ€™s just a matter of removing two screws.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m glad I sorted this problem without breaking my bank account.</p>
