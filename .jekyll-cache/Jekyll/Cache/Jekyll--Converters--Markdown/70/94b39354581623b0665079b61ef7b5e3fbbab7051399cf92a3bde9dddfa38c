<p>This is going to be a long running post, so it is going to stay in draft mode for a very long time. I’ve got until the 26th of April to write the server side code but if I finish earlier that is errors and bugs that I can fix. Until then this post will be open.</p>

<p>The reason to use SPA framework is because they feel like a mobile application, they don’t stop or stall while you move through the page making you feel it is a very reactive interface, almost as a desktop application.</p>

<p>I will write the code by following the ten requirements of the web application and using Max’s course in Udemy as a refresher through it whenever I feel I’m stuck (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/learn/v4/t/lecture/5866976?start=0">reference</a>)</p>

<p>I didn’t feel the course from Max was enough for the backend so I’m going to the course of Andrew Mead for this. I reset the progress, is a course I already did long time ago, so I’m going to start from scratch on it.</p>

<h3 id="import-lectures">Import lectures</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Video 9: reminds you how to use string interpolation inside JS.</li>
  <li>Video 10: how to import from relative paths (other files) and how to use <strong>exports.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fast-forward">Fast-forward</h2>

<h3 id="expressjs-refresher">Express.js refresher</h3>

<ul>
  <li>V 11: Installing lodash</li>
  <li>V 45: Using middleware (next and next() );</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, following the course step by step is going to waste much more than the 10 hours I’ve got allowed for this project so I’m skipping stuff and directly accessing some sections. Right now I’m on Section 5 Lecture 40, all about Express. This is a just a quick refresher.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/DYFMewSXkAAA3_V.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I bought my computer from Cex, formerly known as Cash Converters, hence why the local username appears as Cex. I couldn’t be bothered to change it.</p>

<p>Now getting into the part of sending JSON back. This is important because is all almost everything we’re going to send from the web server. The front-end in Angular will communicate with a Restful service that will access the Mongo database. So the back-end, the Express.js server I’m building now is that Restful service.</p>

<p>I’m using a chrome extension called JsonView (<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en">reference</a>) to see this, it facilitates shaping the JSON that comes back from the server in a coherent, easy to read and navigate format.</p>

<p>Now I remembered how to set up the static directory with express.static()</p>

<p>Now moving onto templating engines, I’m going to use handlebars. The module name is hbs. I’ll use this for pages that are generated dynamically. Which ones? The SEO ones. <strong>More on this later.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that ‘views’ is the place expressjs by default will search for templates.</p>

<p>Now, with HBS we could just omit the front-end and use it for everything. But that wouldn’t be a responsive website and hence why are we dividing it in two.</p>

<p>Now about passing data to the template. This is video 43.</p>

<p>For styling I’ll use Bootstrap but on the server side code I won’t need it.</p>

<p>Now about using partials for templating, for example to include the copyright code on every code.</p>

<p>I’ve learnt also how to get the current year using helper functions for handlebars. This other page can help understand that (<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-handlebars/">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Request or req is one of the most important objects to access thorugh middleware, this page tells you all the parametres that it holds (<a href="http://www.murvinlai.com/req-and-res-in-nodejs.html">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Note that by default node doesn’t come with all locales and you need to install them and set an environment variable (<a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/full-icu-npm">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Using fs.appendFile a server log can easily be saved of each connection.</p>

<p>Middleware will be used to check authentication for example.</p>

<h3 id="test-driven-js-back-end-development-with-mocha">Test-driven JS back-end development with Mocha.</h3>

<p>This is the start of no more experiments and actually writing my own code. As soon as I’ve got test cases then I can actually write the Rest API. This test cases are an actual <strong>deliverable</strong> so I could append it to the TMA02 as an annex and the EMA.</p>

<p>Remember that Mocha must be saved as –save-dev such as</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm i mocha --save-dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now, beware this is Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) so you will have to explain that and also what the mocha framework is.</p>

<p>Note the way it has to be written in packages.json</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"test": "mocha **test.js", 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that says which files mocha has to check.</p>

<p>So it is a matter of using it(‘The message’, callback) and in the callback use</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>throw new Error('The message');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to get the test. Error can use string templating so you could use that to see what was receive instead.</p>

<p>Now the point is how to test express applications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Video 52. To rerun test when the files change. So use:</p>

    <p>nodemon –exec “npm test”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So now every time the test are changed it reruns. Other way is to use test-watch in packages.json</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"test-watch": "nodemon --exec \"npm test\"",
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now with</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm run test-watch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You get it running</p>

<p>So now you combine Mocha with Expect which is an assertion library. Up to second 36 on video 53, Andrew explains what is an assertion library for, use it for your TMA when you need to justify why you use it. Here there is <strong>cheatsheet</strong> for <strong>expect</strong> (<a href="https://devhints.io/expectjs">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Basically <em>expect</em> saves writing code. Remember that to compare equality of objects toBe doesn’t work but toEqual.</p>

<p>Async calls are a bit harder. This is an example of it, what matters is to add done in the call and in after the return.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>it('should return something', (done) =&gt; {
  aSync('Something', (result) =&gt; {
    expect(result).toBe('Something');
    done();
  });
});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that would do the job. Without calling done the test won’t ever finish.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Videos 55 and 56 are the ones that matter. Testing express applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>Andrew recommends a library called SuperTest that makes it simple (<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest">reference</a>).</p>

<p>The last thing to remember is using <strong>describe</strong> which is part of the Mocha framework to group the tests. This is its usage:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe('Whatever you want to say', () =&gt; {
the test;
the other test;
});
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the things to remember are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to use SuperTest for Express applications.</li>
  <li>To export whichever variable or object you’ll require for the supertests.</li>
  <li>To use describe to group the test cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, without getting the refresher in Mongo I can finally already start writing test code.</p>

<p>Spies can built in with Expect but they aren’t needed for my project.</p>

<p>This link in StackOverflow puts an example of testing a RestAPI and therefore MongoDB by extension (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47570972/testing-mongodb-database-with-mocha-and-request">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Ok, so now I’ve got all the testing and express knowledge refreshed these are the next steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the test cases (first as comments)</li>
  <li>Write the actual test cases, this time for real.</li>
  <li>Create the database to match the test cases.</li>
  <li>Fix all the tests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once step 4 is done I’ll have all the test finished and the back-end up and running.</p>

<h3 id="mongo-before-tests">Mongo before tests.</h3>

<p>It would make sense for me to start instead of by the test cases, by refreshing the Mongo knowledge.</p>

<p>First, let’s create the final DDBB in Mongo Atlas. No point to delay that to later.</p>

<p>Notice the password on MongoDB atlas, at the end has an exclamation (!) because it was a requirement.</p>

<p>Notice that the deployment to stay free has to be in eu-central-1 region. This might be challenging later. This has some interesting pricing</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/cap01.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/Cap02.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you see costs can quickly escalate. But using the free version I pay nothing. Be aware there are no backups on this version so you’ll have to justify that (maybe, simply you can’t afford it but explain the option exist).</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/Cap03.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now. It also tells you which IPs you want to accept. As I change locations and I’m testing from my PC I need to allow everyone. I can restrict this to the EIP of the server once I’m finished.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/Cap04.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the window I’m left with. The control panel.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/03/12/Cap05.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I’ve created a DB named jtadb and a collection named jobapplications. I’ve done this from Mongo Compass (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?filter=enterprise&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=EMEA_UK-IE_CorpEntOnly_Brand_Alpha_FM&amp;utm_keyword=mongo%20compass&amp;utm_device=c&amp;utm_network=g&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_creative=208920642215&amp;utm_matchtype=e&amp;_bt=208920642215&amp;_bk=mongo%20compass&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;jmp=search&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwypjVBRANEiwAJAxlInvfecsHug-TEz4XWRVsIMuNfDMDl1unKxvNvTd7JQLAM99mpjVJKRoCT4sQAvD_BwE#compass">reference</a>).</p>

<p>Note on this library (Universrity of West Ealing) the port 21017 is capped so I had to use my mobile phone as hotspot to get access.</p>

<p>It’s 15:48 and I’m still in the library. I’ve been here since 10am.</p>

<p>Notice how to query an object ID you have to use</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>new ObjectID(theID)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then it works. Now is about using <strong>Mongoose</strong> which is an ORM (object relation mapping…no idea) link here (<a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">reference</a>)</p>

<p>When you save with mongoose from a model it creates a __v variable that is just the version of the data (check video 70).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video 71 is very important as it has all the validators of mongoose.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you add a default the data is added even when you don’t require it.</p>

<h4 id="the-not-so-final-research-before-writing-code">The (not so) final research before writing code.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Video 74 contains the test case I need.</li>
</ul>

<p>beforeEach put before all the cases runs something before the test cases run, like a fixture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video 80 even though it is for Heroku it tells you how to set environment variables for the port. So consider it. It also tells you how to change from local DB to deployment DB.</li>
  <li>Video 81, adds up to v 80 on how to create enviornments in postman to use local or deployment API.</li>
  <li>Video 86, finally talks about creating a test database.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still need to find out how to secure the data by user and that’s something new, not a refresher.</p>

<p>This is the key line to set NODE_ENV to test in both windows and unix</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"test": "export NODE_ENV=test || SET \"NODE_ENV=test\" &amp;&amp; mocha **test.js ",
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It goes inside package.json</p>

<h4 id="the-hopefully--final-research-before-writing-code">The <strong>hopefully</strong>  final research before writing code.</h4>

<p>I forgot about the security and the user login. I can’t create the Rest API without users loging in. This bit is new, I haven’t ever found out how to do this. The login in maikel.uk is quite simple as I’m the only user.</p>

<p>This is all going to be about hashing passwords, creating the user model, etc.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video 88: Passwords are sent in plain text (so use SSL), that is a design decision then. You could do it differently using Angular.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tokens is the weird property.  Access property auth. Not sure what he’s trying to do. Then the actual token value and it’ll be a strong cryptographically secure string.</p>

<p>One of the option of mongoose appart from trim, minlenght, etc, is “unique”. To ensure some detail is unique.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video 88 again at minute 4:53 tells you how to set up custom validators for mongo. It also mentions a library to validate emails called validator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tokens is an advantage from Mongo that you don’t have in other DDBB. Note that when you use fields with unique you need to drop the database and restart it with the fields being unique otherwise it won’t work.</p>

<p>Right, I’m going to stop for today in video 89 and I should start from the beginning of that video the next day I’m on this. I’ve been doing this since this morning, it’s now 10:12pm. That is now 13 hours doing this. I know is more than one week worth of project but that’s precisely the way I’m doing it anyway. In a couple of days I get rid of a couple of weeks worth of work. I work better <strong>at bursts</strong> of work.</p>

<p>The next time I’m back I shall finish this section and move onto the actual code, so I’m going to publish this post instead an continue in the next one with what is left of authentication, security and the actual test code.</p>
