<p>My life has been quite stressful lately. Iâ€™ve got pressure coming from many places.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TMA to deliver on the 17th of this month for the project module.</li>
  <li>TMA to deliver on the 2nd of May for another module</li>
  <li>Exam in June</li>
  <li>The video editing isnâ€™t producing enough money.</li>
  <li>A 740 something pounds council tax bill that Iâ€™ve paid with the credit card and is royally messing with my finances.</li>
  <li>Videos that Iâ€™ve got to edit.</li>
  <li>The fact that Iâ€™m <strong>heartbroken.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>My love life is complicated, so I wonâ€™t ever talk about it here. Letâ€™s just say Iâ€™ve been heart-broken for the last 3 months and the outlook doesnâ€™t look great. Every time I allow myself the pleasure of meeting someone, all I keep doing is comparing, no matter how hard I try not to. This is probably my biggest distraction.</p>

<p>Soâ€¦.Iâ€™m back at smoking. Why? Because I had to relieve the pressure somehow and this is the only idea that will actually work.</p>

<p>I know by my job description I canâ€™t smoke but is fair enough if I do it <strong>after</strong> work as then the smell wonâ€™t bother anyone.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been 3 years without smoking, I quite because of convictions. I never labelled myself a non-smoker but only a smoker who doesnâ€™t smoke. It is a sad day, but either I need to keep my sanity and this, while I try to reduce the pressure, at least until after that exam, I know for a fact that will do the trick. The trigger has been being heartbroken for so long. If I were not, I wouldnâ€™t have to smoke, all other factors are bearable.</p>

<p>Thenâ€¦I quite once, I can do it again.</p>
