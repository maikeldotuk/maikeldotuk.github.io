<p>I feel I’m heading nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I’ve done everything possible. Have I? I surely have. More accurately: <strong>I’ve done everything that so far has come to my mind</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that there’s no reliable process to get a job. At the end of the day is as much an act of luck as it is of organisation.</p>

<p>I’m adding to all the jobs in the CV a piece of data with the heading “How did I find it” that could help me find new ways now [..]. Well that’s done now.</p>

<p>One of the things I haven’t done is to carpet the city with my CV. Yes, the job offers online have my CV but not the businesses around my area. One of the reasons for this is because first I’ll have to find them. Second one, I can’t just send a generic CV. It has to be minimally tailored at least and this is also one of the slowest methods to find a job when you just need something stable to pay the bills. This is the right strategy when you are already in work but as a temp searching for something better. That is not my scenario.</p>

<h3 id="i-wish-i-never-left-the-job-as-data-scientist">I wish I never left the job as data scientist.</h3>

<p>I’ve never regretted walking away from an unfulfilling job but in this occasion I should have stayed even if just for the money. I left because I thought it was the best for them as they are an startup. I didn’t want my boss to invest all his time and effort in training me just for me to go elsewhere. I was confident the first few weeks that I loved the job. But as time went by, and I really got a good grasp of what the job entailed, I realised my functions were going to be very little, my training would be lacking and my superior couldn’t put all the dedication into my training that he made it look like during the first few weeks. After all, it was a juicy job paid peanuts. I was on the London living wage as a trainee Data Scientist / Python programmer. No one pays that, starters get 25k at least per year. That was my fault though, I am not comfortable asking more than the LLW because I live like a king with it, giving my frugal lifestyle.</p>

<p>But that LLW right now would be the best ever thing. I should have been selfish and stick to it, I just didn’t know yet I was going to move out of the place I am, and therefore I didn’t know I needed the money. If only I knew I needed that money I would have stayed.</p>

<p>It seems that when it comes to work I can’t solve a problem without letting another one be born.</p>

<p>Shall I knew in 2015 that I wouldn’t be able to cope with TM351, a module that I gave up because it was awfully edited by the university (even complained and got a full refund) I would have stayed as Caretaker for the council. That was even better paid than being data scientist, the workload of university can make you poor, especially when you can’t accept anything lower than a 2.1 degree classification because you’ve got post-grad ambitions and you’re studying a degree in a language that you’ve learnt on your own.</p>
