<p>I have started now the Open University end-of-degree project, I can’t carry on postponing it until I find a job and now is the weekend so I’m free to study.</p>

<p>This is the first post about the project, they all will have the tag “theproject” so I can filter them quickly.</p>

<p>Today what I’ve done is to read all the details of TMA01 and started it. I thought it would take me the entire weekend because it is 3000 words. But it didn’t <strong>I finished it in the space of 6 hours</strong>. Let’s say 7 if we count the time of reading, higlighting and having a rough idea of what was required before I started typing non-stop.</p>

<p>I’ve never done a TMA this quick. Beware that it is a draft though, not a fully finished one. My tutor wanted an early draft to see how am I going. Hence why I wrote this early. That TMA (which means “tutor-marked assigment”) is not due until the 6th of March.</p>

<p>Now, the next step is to start researching elastic clouds. My entire site is in an EC2 in AWS. But I’ve never made them autoscale.</p>

<p>This is a gantt chart of my project outline. It’s amazing to think that in 214 days I’ll be free of university.</p>

<p>Next post will be about how my research is going.</p>

<p>I’ve started by adding a “Categories” page as you see above by creating a page with the code on this other one:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/" title="https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/">https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/</a></p>

<p>Now I am going to carry on with TMA02 of TM354 (a software development module) and tomorrow back to the project.</p>
