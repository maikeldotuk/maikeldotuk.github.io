<p>I need to buy time, desperately. Today I worked from home, after that I invested the evening to finding the best suppliers for my new flat because…yeah…I’ve finally moved in. Yay!</p>

<p>I’m a bargain hunter so this took me the entire rest of the night actually. I didn’t have time to study nor today nor the weekend (plus Monday) because I spent it moving from my old flat to here. I also spent 540 pounds in stuff that was needed for the flat and paying the entire year of water bill, a nice surprise, as nice of being stung by a wasp. The results are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Electricity and gas has gone from 680 per year to 486 by changing to a Brighton company called Toto.</li>
  <li>Internet has gone from 8mbps and 0.500 mbps upload (pathetic) at 29.99 pounds per month to 40mbps and 4mbps upload at 25 per month. The reason to point out the upload speed is because when I edit videos, which are big files I need to upload them to the internet. It is impossible to do this on a half a megabyte upload speed. This has gone from Talk Talk to Now TV.</li>
  <li>I changed my own mobile phone contract from 15 pounds a month for 30gb of data I never use to 11 pounds a month for 8gb of data.</li>
  <li>As mentioned we paid the water, exactly 299 pounds, my share is 150.</li>
  <li>I checked all options and exception to reduce the council tax, the, <strong>by far</strong>, most expensive bill of all. And I didn’t find any loophole or reason for a discount. That is a 1400 pound annual bill that needs to be paid. 700 pounds per head.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I’m trying to do is to pay all the bills now so all my flat expenses are reduced to the 775 pounds of rent. Anyway moving on.</p>

<p>I haven’t touched a book project related nor module related this entire weekend. I don’t like playing catching-up. I need to organise better, and not only for university work but for many tasks I need to get started that I am just postponing again and again and again let alone my social life becoming basically nonexistent.</p>
