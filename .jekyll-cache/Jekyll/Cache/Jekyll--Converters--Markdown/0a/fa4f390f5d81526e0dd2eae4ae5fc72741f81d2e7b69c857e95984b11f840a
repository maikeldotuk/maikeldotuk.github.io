I"<p>Jobseeking is over….<strong>for now</strong>. I’ve signed my work contract today and it guarantees a minimum of 20 hours per week at 310 pounds.</p>

<p>Even working at that minimum I can cover the rent and my expenses. Let alone the extras such as self-employment and the cleaning of E’s place every week.</p>

<p>Today arrived the student oyster card so that’s more savings. I’m all set. I can move on, I can study, I can do my project.</p>

<p>Now I just need to pick up the pace with the project and the other module (<a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/modules/tm354?">TM354 - Software Engineering</a>) to continue afterwards just studying on it. The last thing to be fixed is the flat. I haven’t heard back from the letting’s agency. All I know is that LetRef has all the references needed, including the ones from the guarantor. <strong>Let’s be optimistic.</strong></p>

<h3 id="so-what-would-i-like-to-do-now">So what would I like to do now</h3>

<p>I want to book a holiday, and I mean a real proper one. One for exactly the day after I finish my degree in a warm enough place.</p>

<p>I want to feel I am the best at my job, I want to feel I am making a difference and that I am valued. I want to get Sage certifications to have a safety net for more admin / payroll jobs.</p>

<p>I want a new laptop but I don’t want to pay it financed. Nor do I want a screen smaller than 17 inches.</p>

<p>I want pijama parties in my new flat every Friday evening. I want a better social life. I want to connect with people related to the software development world, especially DevOps, full stack javascript connoisseurs, and people that in general know how to get some self-employment skills (my boss knows this last one though).</p>

<p>I want to know if I can use Bark.com to give quotes for software development projects.</p>

<p>I need a bit more of organisation though, I feel life is spinning a bit out of control lately. I suppose is the fact that I have no savings, I feel very very uncomfortable when I don’t have any savings. All the money I have is for the deposit and first month of the flat. I feel save when I’ve got 2000 pounds in my bank account and growing. I’m not a expender, I’m a saver.</p>

<p>I have barely slept today, my head is racing, I can’t concentrate in anything. I just want to switch off my brain but I just can’t. I’m doing everything I can to stop me from learning everything that’s there to learn about Terraform because I know if I start I won’t stop until I finish. IT gets me that passionate.</p>

<p>I’ve changed my hair today. I just wanted to see how it would look without the grey ones. So, as you see in the top, it looks way darker now.</p>
