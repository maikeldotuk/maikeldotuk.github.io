<p>I had a discount on another course of Stephane and as I have one week ahead, since I already know how to do the stress test I paid for it. It is the CloudFormation course. And sounds very handy for the project.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-cloudformation">What is CloudFormation</h3>

<p>It helps you define an entire cloud in a YAML template. That implies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The security policy</li>
  <li>The ELB</li>
  <li>The EC2 machines.</li>
  <li>The network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically it is ideal for my project. It could find as a going through a rabit hole, but no. It is exactly what I need for the project.</p>

<p>Cloudformation is free, the resources might not be. Apply the knowledge from the previous course.</p>

<p>Budget it for 10 dollars. So you get an alert.</p>

<p>An alternative to CloudFormation is Ansible/Terraform you could use this info for your project. Video 6 explains it.</p>

<p>When you run CloudFormation it will automatically terminate the previous instance it created.</p>

<p><strong>Deleting a STack deletes every artifact (EC2) that the CloudFormation stack created.</strong></p>

<p>Stacks must have unique names.</p>

<p>Section 2 (video 10) teaches YAML</p>

<p>YAML works with Key value pairs delimited by a colon, nested objects (like JSON) but with an structure similar to Python code. Arrays are delimited with - (minus) comments come with a hashtag.</p>

<p>An S3 bucket created with CloudFormation can be updated without interruption (adding AccessControl). Be careful to do this otherwise you might delete it.</p>

<p>On updates of S3 always preview changes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to finish this entire section 2 (Cloudformation First Hand-On) and give up for today.</p>

<p>Video 16 is crucial becuase it shows the designer.</p>

<p>YOu canâ€™t run custom scripts on cloud formation (but you can run custom AMIsâ€¦so)</p>
