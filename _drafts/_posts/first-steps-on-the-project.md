## To add on TMA01

Forgot to mention any connectivity through a Rest API. The project needs to connect to one otherwise it wouldn't do enough of TM352 stuff.

Right, today I'm checking this

[https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ "https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/")

And it mentions two parts, autoscaling with EC2 and CloudWatch fees. And DynamoDB which I guess is where the DB will be. 

Apparently I've got to learn about CloudFormation. At least I know for now that autoescaling is free. 

Right the requisite is to have a CloudFormation so reading this:

[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/")

Good, CloudFormation is also free

[https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/ "https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/pricing/")

Here some examples of code for CloudFormation

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html")

At the end is easier to buy this course and start from there. It's only 3 hours.
