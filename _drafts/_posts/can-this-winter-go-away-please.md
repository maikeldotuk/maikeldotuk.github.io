In a few hours we'd be in March yet London is covered in a thick layer of snow and ice. That's awful. 

Yesterday I sent a TMA (tutor-marked assignment for university) that was due today. I didn't expect to finish it so soon, I even asked for an extension two days ago. I rushed through it and didn't really make an effort writting it, so even though it is finished I feel bad that I didn't do my best on it. I've been too busy jobseeking and that's why I couldn't dedicate as much time as I should. I'm not good at concentrating on more than one task at a time **when** there is an urgent one stopping them all. Finding a job was urgent. 

### The flat

I can't wait for all the referencing to be done and the contract signed. To be honest is what is keeping me awake every day. To be honest I have felt homeless for many years. Having a written contract for an entire flat (not a room) even though it is co-signed with someone, in the city in which I've been wanting to settle down for many years is a **very big deal.** That is something I've been wanting to have sorted ever since I moved to the UK in June 2011. 

### My biggest engine

Is my survival instinct. It can override anything. As such:

* providing a roof over my head that is **_safe_** _enough_
* finding a job that is **secure** enough and allows me to avoid money directing my life. 

Are my two main priorities. 

This house, this contract that I am signing as it not attached to a friendship, nor a relationship, nor a cleaning-to-save-in-rent aggreement is a major step forward. 

I've usually managed to get my rent extremely cheap but then in exchange the landlord treated me as a guest and not as a tenant. If you want the full benefits of being a tenant and feel at home in your rented home, you need to pay the full price. 

Then on the other side, jobs. I'm finishing this degree to guarantee an income. I honestly don't want to work in IT full time. I prefer admin jobs like the one I have now. Software Development is something I like sporadically and I want to pursue that path as a freelance business aside of a main full time admin job. 

I don't want to be programming _scared_ because my salary depends on it. I prefer a safe income with an admin role and then program with a clear concience. 

### Solitude

I haven't seen one single member of my family in more than seven years. There are even new members and I don't even know their names because my sisters have had children. Do I hate my family? No, I don't. I'm just a lone wolf. I'm a strange person, I love solitude. I generally reduce my social life to a handful of people, sometimes even just to one person. No one can ever guess by seeing me, all my acquaintances believe I've got an incredibly busy social life. 

This need for solitude is the reason I left London on 2012 and moved to the North West (to come back on 2015), I was sick of never being alone. Yet, I was in very different circumstances, I could barely speak English, I was living in a room with 3 more guys on it (the bedroom, not the flat)....so I had literally no privacy for more than a year. 

How did I deal with that coming from my own appartment in the city centre of Seville is a mystery. That is how much I was tired of living unchallenged in Spain. 

This flat I'm moving to means **The World** to me. It means growing up unconstrained. Solitude makes my creativity limitless. The thought of having to wait 23 days more for it after 6 and a half years desperately in need of it just makes me anxious. I would only have peace of mind once the contract is signed. 

I'm the kind of person who always expects the worse while keeps working to get the best.
