In a few hours we'd be in March yet London is covered in a thick layer of snow and ice. That's awful. 

Yesterday I sent a TMA (tutor-marked assignment for university) that was due today. I didn't expect to finish it so soon, I even asked for an extension two days ago. I rushed through it and didn't really make an effort writting it, so even though it is finished I feel bad that I didn't do my best on it. I've been too busy jobseeking and that's why I couldn't dedicate as much time as I should. I'm not good at concentrating on more than one task at a time **when** there is an urgent one stopping them all. Finding a job was urgent. 

### The flat

I can't wait for all the referencing to be done and the contract signed. To be honest is what is keeping me awake every day. To be honest I have felt homeless for many years. Having a written contract for an entire flat (not a room) even though it is co-signed with someone, in the city in which I've been wanting to settle down for many years is a **very big deal.** That is something I've been wanting to have sorted ever since I moved to the UK in June 2011. 

### My biggest engine

Is my survival instinct. It can override anything. As such:

* providing a roof over my head that is **_safe_** _enough_
* finding a job that is **secure** enough and allows me to avoid money directing my life. 

Are my two main priorities.
