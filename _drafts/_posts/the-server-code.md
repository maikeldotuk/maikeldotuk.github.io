This is going to be a long running post, so it is going to stay in draft mode for a very long time. I've got until the 26th of April to write the server side code but if I finish earlier that is errors and bugs that I can fix. Until then this post will be open.

The reason to use SPA framework is because they feel like a mobile application, they don't stop or stall while you move through the page making you feel it is a very reactive interface, almost as a desktop application.

I will write the code by following the ten requirements of the web application and using Max's course in Udemy as a refresher through it whenever I feel I'm stuck ([reference](https://www.udemy.com/angular-2-and-nodejs-the-practical-guide/learn/v4/t/lecture/5866976?start=0))

I didn't feel the course from Max was enough for the backend so I'm going to the course of Andrew Mead for this. I reset the progress, is a course I already did long time ago, so I'm going to start from scratch on it.
