Jobseeking is over....for now. I've signed my work contract today and it guarantees a minimum of 20 hours per week at 310 pounds. 

Even working at that minimum I can cover the rent and my expenses. Let alone the extras such as self-employment and the cleaning of E's place every week. 

Today arrived the student oyster card so that's more savings. I'm all set. I can move on, I can study, I can do my project.
