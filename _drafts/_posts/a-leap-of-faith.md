Today I have had an exhausting day and I should never organise this poorly. I've decided to give up on the Meter Reader jobs (yep, plural, I was offered the other one too) and carry on with the P.A. / Support Worker role. 

It's just much more rewarding, it's not a dead-end job, I feel good doing it.
