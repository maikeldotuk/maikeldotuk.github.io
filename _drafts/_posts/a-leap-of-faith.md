Today I have had an exhausting day and I should never organise this poorly. I've decided to give up on the Meter Reader jobs (yep, plural, I was offered the other one too) and carry on with the P.A. / Support Worker role.

It's just much more rewarding, it's not a dead-end job, I feel good doing it, I feel I'm not shitting on my CV but improving it while doing this job. I'm earning powerful skills and powerful experience to write down on it. 

But in the morning I went to E's place to clean up. We've arranged last week that I would go and clean up the house for 12 pounds an hour + transport, during 3 hours. That's a total of 40 pounds. It's basically light clean the kitchen, deep clean the bathroom, change the bed sheets, hoover the entire flat and then iron their (he and his girlfriend) shirts. 

Once it is all done he transfer me the money. I trust the guy because he was my roommate long time ago when I used to live in Bayswater on a hostel for long-stays (Leinster House). That means we know each other very well, we literally lived in the same room (not flat but room) for almost a year. Now he's got a job in the City and I'm about to finish my degree so we've gone both far. 

### But then the phone rang...

And a text message showed up there, my new boss, let's call him B (of boss) asked me to go to the town hall to do 3 hours of admin tasks so there I went. With just half an hour to cook, eat, shower and change. 

I went and I had an assigment of 89 pages of text that need to be proof-read and compared across an original. The text is written in a very simple English to be able to be read by people with cognitive or learning dissabilities (and other dissabilities) so I have also to check that it is well explained. It was a very interested read (I was loving it) yet I couldn't shake the though of the flat I'm moving in. The reason for it is that we've started all the paperwork. The agency sent me today a link to LetRef, an online tool for agencies to automate the process of checking references of tenants. 

### The guarantor

P (with whom I live) is going to be my guarantor since I've been living on an average of 500 pounds a month budget for almost two years since I started self-employment. I didn't need a penny more because I don't currently pay rent nor bills so I, instead, invested my time in having the highest possible marks on my degree. **Hence why I've got a guaranteed 2.1** expecting me by September. 

Now that I'm going back to employment (without quitting the self-employed bit) it would be just stupid to lose that house so P is going to be my guarantor to give some peace of mind ot the estate agency. 

I feel like a lion in a cage, in fact that is exactly my profile image on Whatsapp. I need to relieve some pressure:

* The flat. 
* The rent of the flat
* The inestability of jobs
* The job search that never ends
* The project that needs continuous attention
* The TMA that needs to be finished before the 28th. 

Aw dear, dear, dear....yeap, like the text above this is like having a bloody pyramid on top of my shoulders, not a stone. 

### But the job search morphs

I'm going to take a leap of faith and trust this job is going to be for 2 months at 21 or more hours. So I'm going to put it on my CV as experience as:

* Personal Assistance
* Support Worker
* Administrator
* Payroll
* Leads Genearator/Follower/chaser ?
* Webmaster

Because that's all the jobs that I would be doing with it. See why I want this job so badly, it's full of new skills and/or experience that I could **now** write down on the CV. With that it'll be easier to get into an admin, payroll jobs or even pursuing a career as P.A., which honestly sounds awesome.
