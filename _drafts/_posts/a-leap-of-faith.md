Today I have had an exhausting day and I should never organise this poorly. I've decided to give up on the Meter Reader jobs (yep, plural, I was offered the other one too) and carry on with the P.A. / Support Worker role.

It's just much more rewarding, it's not a dead-end job, I feel good doing it, I feel I'm not shitting on my CV but improving it while doing this job. I'm earning powerful skills and powerful experience to write down on it. 

But in the morning I went to E's place to clean up. We've arranged last week that I would go and clean up the house for 12 pounds an hour + transport, during 3 hours. That's a total of 40 pounds. It's basically light clean the kitchen, deep clean the bathroom, change the bed sheets, hoover the entire flat and then iron their (he and his girlfriend) shirts. 

Once it is all done he transfer me the money. I trust the guy because he was my roommate long time ago when I used to live in Bayswater on a hostel for long-stays (Leinster House). That means we know each other very well, we literally lived in the same room (not flat but room) for almost a year. Now he's got a job in the City and I'm about to finish my degree so we've gone both far.
