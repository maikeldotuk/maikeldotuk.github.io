        <p>This is a blog in which I keep a log about how am I progressing with
rooting down in London and especially my job search.</p>

<p>I’ve lived in the UK since 2011 and since 2013 I’ve been a part time student of Computing Science. I came to the UK out of interest to improve my English but by 2013 it was good enough to progress into university.</p>

<p>I’ve been in many places not just London, I spend around 2 years in several citis on the North West, to come back on January 2015 to London and finally settle in Acton.</p>

<p>This is my final year at university. I do not intend to pursue a career as software developer full time, I do intend to keep it as a freelance job for sporadic ventures.</p>
