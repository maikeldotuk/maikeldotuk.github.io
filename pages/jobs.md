In this page I'm going to detail the kind of jobs I am searching for. I've divided it in two, on one section the ones as employee and on the other one the freelance / contract ones.  These are just the few I could come up with, surely there are more.

## Jobs sought as employee

As an employee I look for long-term stability and career progression.

* Trainee DevOps. 
* Trainee Full Stack JavaScript Web Developer
* Trainee Back-end JavaScript Developer

## Freelance gigs

As a freelancer I prefer to venture into discovery of new fields and technologies. I've rarely fully known how to do what I am asked, but I do my own research and learn it as I go along. As I don't have a boss but a deadline, I can afford to learn as I work hence why I can take bigger risks.

* Video Editor
* Full Stack Javascript Developer (Angular, Mongo, ExpressJs, Node)
* Cloud architect (AWS, Terraform, Ubuntu, Docker). 
* Web-site scraper (Python, Scrapy, Airflow)
* PC builder (yes, I can mount PCs)
