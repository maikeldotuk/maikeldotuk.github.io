In this page I'm going to detail the kind of jobs I am searching for. I've divided it in two, on one section the ones as employee and on the other one the freelance / contract ones. As you see they are completely different. These are just the few I could come up with, surely there are more.

## Jobs sought as employee
As an employee I look for long-term stability and career progression.
* Data Entry or Typist
* Administrator Assistant
* Accounts Assistant
* Payroll Clerk
* General Office Clerk jobs
* Datacentre Operator
* Cleaner or Caretaker only exceptionally when I just need a job quickly.

## Freelance gigs
As a freelancer I prefer to venture into discovery of new fields and technologies. I've rarely fully known how to do what I am asked, but I do my own research and learn it as I go along.
* Video Editor
* Full Stack Javascript Developer (Angular, Mongo, ExpressJs, Node)
* Front-End Developer
* NativeScript developer
* Web-site scraper (Python, Scrapy, Airflow)
* PC builder (yes, I can mount PCs)
