# The issue

By contract, today 15th of June I've got to tell whether I'm staying in my flat or leaving it. This isn't an easy decision to make so here I am weighting all options. Let's make a table.

## Pros of Staying

* Not having to move
* Knowing for sure you share with 1 or two.
* It's the simplest option.
* Can decide every month.
* Maremagnum just outside

## Pros of Leaving

* Find a cheaper flat
* Avoid mosquitoes
* Avoid the heat.
* Find a final place?
* Find a quieter place.
* Spend less if stuff is farther.

An important thing to remember is the fact this isn't about staying or leaving Barcelona. This is about this flat only. The best thing to consider is, if I stayed in Barcelona, do I want to do it in this flat?

# Possible scenarios

## Scenario 1. Leaving on the last day of June.

So, I pack all my stuff and move to a friend's place nearby. From there I decide what to do next. The options are limitless. I can go back to the UK, stay in Barcelona in a better flat, go to Andorra, stay with my parents for a while.
If I went back to the UK, for now, I would have to stay in the same place 14 days.

## Scenario 2. Staying until the end of July.

That buys time and gives me options for other stuff. The main thing for which this buys time is to get over the UK lockdown rules but that doesn't necessarily mean I want to go there. 

This also buys time if I want to try my luck finding work directly in Barcelona. 

## So...decision

I chose the end of the month. Ignoring all other factors, this flat never really convinced me.
