# The issue

By contract, today 15th of June I've got to tell whether I'm staying in my flat or leaving it. This isn't an easy decision to make so here I am weighting all options. Let's make a table.

## Pros of Staying

* Not having to move
* Knowing for sure you share with 1 or two. 
* It's the simplest option. 
* Can decide every month. 

## Pros of Leaving

* Find a cheaper flat 
* Avoid mosquitoes
* Avoid the heat. 
* Find a final place?


An important thing to remember is the fact this isn't about staying or leaving Barcelona. This is about this flat only. The best thing to consider is, if I stayed in Barcelona, do I want to do it in this flat?
