# The issue

By contract, today 15th of June I've got to tell whether I'm staying in my flat or leaving it. This isn't an easy decision to make so here I am weighting all options. Let's make a table.

| Option | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staying | Sharing with 1 or two<br> | Mosquitoes<br>Expensive for sharing<br>Too hot<br>Clearly not a final place |
| Leaving | Find a cheaper flat | Moving stuff around<br>Having to find another place |

An important thing to remember is the fact this isn't about staying or leaving Barcelona.This is about this flat only. The best thing to consider is, if i stayed in Barcelona, do i want to do it in this flat ?
