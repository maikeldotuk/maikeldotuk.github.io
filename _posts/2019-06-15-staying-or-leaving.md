# The issue

By contract, today 15th of June I've got to tell whether I'm staying in my flat or leaving it. This isn't an easy decision to make so here I am weighting all options. Let's make a table. 

Option|Pros|Cons
---|---|---
Staying| Sharing with 1 or two<br>| Mosquitoes<br>Expensive for sharing<br>Too hot<br>Clearly not a final place
Leaving|Find a cheaper flat|Moving stuff around<br>Having to find another place

an important thing to remember is the fact this isnt about staying or leaving Barcelona.This is about this flat only. The best thing to consider is, if i stayed in Barcelona, do i want to do it in this flat ?
