## The figures


![Hello, I am the coronavirus](./covid.jpg)

Today as you know is 18th of May of 2020. There has been in Spain 27,650 deaths according to [Covid19info.live](https://covid19info.live/spain). That figure keeps getting lower and finding new records as days go. Soon it'll be ridiculous to still be in a lockdown.

It gets tyring. I've got exhaustion of Covid information to be honest. 


## The lockdown

The lockdown or 'Estado de Alarma' in which we find ourselves makes very little sense now. These are the biggest errors I see so far:
* **Nobody is wearing the masks correctly**. Even those who think they do are wearing them inside out, which causes the strings to cause a separation of the fabric on the cheeks, therefore anyone standing by any of your sides is receiving all of your breath, cough, etc. 
* Police aren't really fining anybody. 
* People keep going out whenever they feel like it, including parents with children. 
* Parents let their kids play in parks, which means they all touch the same things. 
* *People walk too close to each other*. No one is complying with the 2-metre distance rule. 
* You can see your friends, by arranging to meet at the shops, which causes **overcrowding** but you can't go to see them at their homes. 

But somehow, the figures are getting better, so I can only see that we're just lucky. I have zero confidence in the goverment being the cause of the success to get the figures so low. I believe it is pure chance, something has happened in the spread of the virus that has caused it to, somehow, stop spreading. People are being **to careless** for the figures to go so low so quick. 

Anyhow, whatever the reason this first wave is almost over, I'm pretty sure a second one is going to come anytime soon. When that happens, wherever we are, we're going to be stuck for a while. So these are the best questions that I wonder:

> Who would you take to a deserted island?

and

> In which island (meaning: country) do you want to be stuck?

All of a sudden choosing which flat am I moving into, which I'm due for on the 18th of July, it's a much more transcendental choice.
