I've started by creating a git init for the backend as I didn't notice I didn't have it version controlled.

But now that is finished and I'm going to refactor the whole thing and clean it up for the TMA it must be version controlled.

### One day later

I haven't only refactored but I have also added documentation of the entire API. Using a tool called apidocs which was incredibly easy to learn. I will use it again for my own site in www.maikel.uk

Now the backend is finished and deployed in 

[https://www.maikel.uk/project/](https://www.maikel.uk/project/ "https://www.maikel.uk/project/")

The result is in the image above this post which I will probably use for TMA02. Which I'm going to start writing now. 

It took me just 3 hours to get all the documentation written and the backend deployed on my website.
