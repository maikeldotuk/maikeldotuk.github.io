I didn't find any job nor nothing to do today (Sunday) so I thought, fuck it. I can't lose that bedroom, I need **any** job, even if it's just as a placeholder for a better one. Just one that could get the agency to allow me to sign the tenancy agreement.

So I thought, cleaner, it's always the safe choice. It's always the hateful choice too. I feel every time I fallback into it I'm setting myself for failure to get out of it.

Yet I'm a bloody good cleaner. Which isn't much of a celebration considering it doesn't need any special qualifications.

I did the math and the absolute minimum for me to get above the bedroom and still have enough for food is 8 pounds an hour and 37.5 hours a week. That's 300 pounds a week. If we count taxes inside it I might need to work for 9 pounds per hour or more. 

So I need to find a job that pays no less than 8 pounds an hour and offers at least 37.5 hours.

I've applied today to 32 jobs as cleaner. It was soul-crashing. If the only job I get is a cleaning job I'll spend the next 8 month in hell, since I won't be able to job-seek any further as soon as I start my degree final project in just a few days.
