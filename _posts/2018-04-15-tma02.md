This is the post with all the content running up to TMA02.

Well, I've created, edited, finished the TMA and sent it. What is new that was included is:

* Added the Volere template as requested by the tutor. 
* Described the stages of software development as requested. 
* Amended the schedule, I now have to finish the entire thing before middle of July. 

This TMA has been less work than the one before but that doesn't matter, is the project what takes time not the TMAs. I need too free-up tie.
