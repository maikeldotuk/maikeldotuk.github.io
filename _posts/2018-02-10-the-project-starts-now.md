I have started now the Open University end-of-degree project, I can't stop postponing it until I find a job and is the weekend so I'm free to study. 

This is the first post about the project, they all will have the tag "theproject" so I can filter them quickly. 

Today what I've done is to read all the details of TMA01 and start it. I thought it would take me the entire weekend because it is 3000 words. But it didn't I finished it in the space of 6 hours. Let's say 7 if we count the time of reading, higlighting and having a rough idea of what was required before I started typing non-stop. 

I've never done a TMA this quick. Beware that it is a draf though, not a fully finished one. My tutor wanted an early draft to see how am I going. Hence why I wrote this early. That TMA (which means "tutor-marked assigment") is not due until the 6th of March. 

Now, the next step is to start researching elastic clouds. My entire site is in an EC2 in AWS. But I've never made them autoscale.

This is a gantt chart of my project outline. It's amazing to think that in 214 days I'll be free of university.
