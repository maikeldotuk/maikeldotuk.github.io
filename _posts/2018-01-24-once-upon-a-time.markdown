## So, what is this?
This is a blog, created in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a simple static page creator for blogs that does not require a database. I didn't know how to use it, never heard of it, until two hours ago.

At around 3pm today I started a search about blogging platforms, I'm already aware and knowledgeable of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/) (I had a self-hosted blog for about 7 years) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) so I wanted a bit of a challenge.

I've gone through the basics, then set it up in Github Pages and modified my domain configuration to use blog.maikel.uk instead of maikeldotuk.github.io. I already know markup because of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) (and [Reddit](www.reddit.com)) so that's the easy part.

## And what will this blog be about?

I'm going to keep track here of my job-seeking activities, writing the challenges I'm finding so I can overcome them. Sometimes thinking out loud helps find solutions, **for me is writing what helps.**

Once I find a a job I'll carry on talking about how [my project](http://css2.open.ac.uk/outis/descs/mc_courses/TM470.htm) at university is going. Which is the main reason I'm trying to find a job so quickly: my project's first TMA is due on March.

## Are you a student?

Indeed I am, I study Computing Science in the [Open University](www.open.ac.uk), the leading distance learning education of the UK. I started in 2013 a BSc in Computing and IT, with a speciality on Software Development. The entire degree is 360 credits and I've completed already 300 of them. I'm right now doing the remaining 60 and I'll finish it by September 2018. Yep, that's in 8 months.

## What will you do when you graduate?

Nothing much. I took the degree because I didn't want to waste my time in the UK. I came here originally just to learn English, then stayed for that degree. Then I stop wanting to move elsewhere. I've have my experiences working as an employee as a Software Developer and honestly **I just did't like it**. There's a reason Soft.Devel jobs are paid so highly, very few people would actually enjoy them.

Most people believe that you spend the day programming stuff you actually love, but that's not the reality, you end up being constrained to some programming language, some framework and doing menial stuff continuously for others. Stuff you don't believe in. You could argue that most jobs are like that, I can counter-argue that most jobs don't consist on solving-sudokus non-stop. And that's what programming is about.

What I want to do is to use my knowledge in **freelance** jobs on my spare time and personal projects. That won't limit me on what I can and cannot learn. For an overview of what I am already knowledgeable (but not limited) off have a look at [maikel.uk](https://www.maikel.uk) and you will see my skillset.

## What have you done in the past?

I am interested in many sort of jobs, I've been:
- Estate Agency Coordinator
- Cleaner (yes, cleaner, and worse, enjoyed it).
- Shift Manager for a gay sauna.
- Call centre agent (Rentalcars, Natwest Mortgages, Orange).
- Caretaker for one of London's councils.
- IT Operator in a data centre for 2 banks.
- IT Support for an European Union organism.

The list never ends and that's not counting what I've done as freelancer, currently I keep all the bills paid by editing videos.

## What do you really want to do now?

I want to work in an office setting because I enjoy excelling at what I do. It keeps me going. I type above 90 words per minute and I automate almost everything I do with a computer. Using this knowledge I usually stand out in office jobs that require the user of a computer. I don't want to try more roles, I want to grow roots in a company. My interest are two-fold, on one side you've got what I really want to do as an *employee* and on the other side what I want to do on my spare time *freelancing*.

As an employee I look for stability, as a freelancer I look for fun.

### As an employee:
Stability and long-term are a must so I'm looking for roles of the type:
- Data Entry / Typist.
- Administrator Assistant
- Accountant Assistant


### As freelancer:
The main reason I don't want to try being a Software Developer as a career goal is because I've got too many interests. These are the things I can do.
- NativeScript a programmer. This is a platform that allows you to design apps that are cross-platform compatible iOS and Android.
- Angular developer.
- Full stack javascript developer.
- Web Scraper with Python and Scrapy.
- Front-end Web Developer.
As you see this covers too many disciplines and evolves with time, reason for which I wouldn't ever enjoy being prisoner of a framework and programming language for any company. I rather do eventual contracted jobs so I can move on after I finish.
