## So, what is this?
This is a blog, created in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a simple static page creator for blogs that do not require a database. I didn't know how to use it, never heard of it, until two hours ago.

At around 3pm today I started a search about blogging platforms, I'm already aware and knowledgeable of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/download/) (I had a self-hosted blog for about 7 years) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) so I wanted a bit of a challenge.

I've gone through the basics, then set it up in Github Pages and modified my domain configuration to use blog.maikel.uk instead of maikeldotuk.github.io. I already know markup because of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) (and [Reddit](www.reddit.com)) so that's the easy part.

## What is this about?

I'm going to keep track here of my job-seeking activities, writing the challenges I'm finding so I can overcome them. Sometimes thinking out loud helps find solutions, **for me is writing what helps.**
