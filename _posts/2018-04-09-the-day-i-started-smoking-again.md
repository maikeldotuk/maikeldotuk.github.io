My life is a mess. I've got pressure coming from many places.

* TMA to deliver on the 17th of this month for the project module.
* TMA to deliver on the 2nd of May for another module
* Exam in June
* The video editing isn't producing enough money.
* A 740 something pounds council tax bill that I've paid with the credit card and is royally messing with my finances.
* Videos that I've got to edit.
* The fact that I'm **heartbroken.**

My love life is complicated, so I won't ever talk about it here. Let's just say I've been heart-broken for the last 3 months and the outlook doesn't look great. Every time I allow myself the pleasure of meeting someone, all I keep doing is comparing, no matter how hard I try not to. This is probably my biggest distraction.

So....I'm back at smoking. Why? Because I had to relieve the pressure somehow and this is the only idea that will actually work.

I know by my job description I can't smoke but is fair enough if I do it **after** work as then the smell won't bother anyone.

I've been 3 years without smoking, I quite because of convictions. I never labelled myself a non-smoker but only a smoker who doesn't smoke. It is a sad day, but either I need to keep my sanity and this, while I try to reduce the pressure, at least until after that exam, I know for a fact that will do the trick. 

Then...I quite once, I can do it again.
