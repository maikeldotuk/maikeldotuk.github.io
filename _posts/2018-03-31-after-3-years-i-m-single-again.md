There's nothing to be sad for, I really wanted to recover this freedom, this lack of responsibility for someone else's happiness. That relationship was dead long time ago. 

I had a wonderful boyfriend I didn't deserve and which I was eager to set free. The guilt of being with him knowing this was eating my soul. Now that he's officially free, I'm guilt-free and as result I'm happier. 

I didn't mention in this blog that the **main** reason I was moving out of the flat I was before was **precisely** that I was living with my, now, ex-partner. Not only did I need space, I also needed to distance myself from him so I could set him free. 

That's the entire reason I needed to find an additional job, I didn't have to pay rent on that flat as he owns it. He is a wonderful person, we broke up amicably, we've got a cat and she's today here. We live walking distance now. 

I admire him, and protect him specially of myself, so I planned this break up for months to avoid hurting him and fortunately it worked. I feel fine and so does he. Now he can find someone else that he really deserves and I can carry on finishing my BSc in Computing Science.
