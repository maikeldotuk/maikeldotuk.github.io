So today is my birthday. For security reasons I'm not saying here how old I am as otherwise that would give the internet my full DOB details which implies people could open bank accounts and other things with it. 

I'm not doing anything especial to celebrate. I've got a lot of university work to get over with. There's that tutor marked assignment (TMA) that I need to finish before the 28th and there's my end-of-degree project that I need to move forward. 

Appart from that today I've been working for B. I did the third part of the 3 subjobs that the job is. This one was my favourite probably as there's a lot of room for flexibility and doing things more efficiently. 

I feel more calm, more safe, more reassured about the hours I'm going to do. I am now wondering: **are the two months at 21 hours set in stone?** In the sense of...why couldn't it be 21 hours past those two months? I think I could actually make a difference big enough for B to reconsider keeping me around with those hours longer than 2 months. If not, it's fine, I'll move on but I will try my best anyway. 

Expect the best but prepare for the worst.
