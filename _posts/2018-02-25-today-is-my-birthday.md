So today is my birthday. For security reasons I'm not saying here how old I am as otherwise that would give the internet my full DOB details which implies people could open bank accounts and other things with it.

I'm not doing anything especial to celebrate. I've got a lot of university work to get over with. There's that tutor marked assignment (TMA) that I need to finish before the 28th and there's my end-of-degree project that I need to move forward.

Appart from that today I've been working for B. I did the third part of the 3 subjobs that the job consist in. This one was my favourite probably as there's a lot of room for flexibility and doing things more efficiently.

I feel more calm, more safe, more reassured about the hours I'm going to do. I am now wondering: **are the two months at 21 hours set in stone?** In the sense of...why couldn't it be 21 hours past those two months? I think I could actually make a difference big enough for B to reconsider keeping me around with those hours longer than 2 months. If not, it's fine, I'll move on but I will try my best anyway.

> Expect the best but prepare for the worst.

## The flat

I need to get out of here.

The paperwork for the new flat with my best friend is being processed. We've paid 300 pounds to the estate agency to start doing the new contract, it includes references and I had to use my current landlord as a guarantor ...long story.

But I feel like a lion in a cage. I don't feel "at ease" in my current place.

I didn't want to move in in September 2015, I was happy where I was, my room was bigger and solely mine but I was short of funds, he offered me to move in, and it was either accepting the offer or moving back to the North West.

I couldn't bear the thought of going back to Manchester so I regretfully accepted. My degree was my top priority and I couldn't do anything that could hinder it. I just needed continuity, quick solutions, moving on so I could study.

I already said from the very beginning, "I do need a lot of space and I fear this won't be enough" and I was right. I don't have any private space in the entire flat. Kitchen and living room are a single room. The flat is beautiful but is just not big enough for two people.

I value my independence and freedom above everything. If I feel like going to the Thames at midnight to just observe the water flowing I want to be able to do so. I haven't been able to do that ever since I move here. Everything I do is observed and commented upon. I hate being micro-managed on my own home.

I feel he is invading my personal space. I feel I can't be alone when I need to. And that is why I'm moving out, because I just can't continue living here so constrained.

Some days I feel very creative and I just want to do my own thing, create a new website from scratch and dedicate the entire day to focus on it. When I do that I am quite passionate and I don't like interruptions, I turn my phone off, prepare a lot of coffee, forget to eat and get it all done.

Some other days I feel like a sponge, I feel I need to learn 100 different things before I can be able to wind down, so I want to focus on a book and read it cover to cover in a day, making notes and really getting the subject.

Either of those two cases I need my personal space, **solitude to get it done**. I haven't have that ever since I moved here. Especially since I'm much more creative/active during the evenings and that's the precise time I am not alone. I'm a night-owl. It's 1:17am right now for example. I normally sleep only 5 to 6 hours and that's enough for me.

I just can't wait to move out so ... I need to find an alternative for the time from now until the 23rd. Maybe I should take a short term bedroom somewhere close.

I've put up an add on a few places (Romeo, Facebook, etc) searching for a short-term bedroom to stay.
