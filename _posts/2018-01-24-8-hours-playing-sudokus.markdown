Imagine that you were paid for playing sudokus, they are all the same with only slighly variations and your career progression is simply to find different ways to play it or to do it faster.

That is what a job in Software Development **as an employee** looks like.

You're constrained in

* The programming language you can use
* The frameworks you can use.
* The ideas that you have.

Basically someone comes with a piece of a very simple problem, in Soft.Devel terms this is called a specification and you've got to write the code for it. This is rarely interesting bits or puzzles to solve but always the same related stuff.

> Now you know why I don't want to work as a Software Developer for anyone.

Look at [maikel.uk](https://www.maikel.uk), if I had to prepare for just one employer I would just know a fraction of what I wrote there. Being a freelancer preserves the fun of it.

You can love sudokus, but if you do the same one every working day of the year for the rest of your life you'll hate it.
