I've decided not to frustrate myself by thinking the worse. I've followed that way of doing stuff for too far and it will kill me.

Sure it worked when I was a teenager or much younger than now. But now that I'm almost 32 I can tell that it will hinder my health and I've got to change tactic to deal with life.

I used to think:

> La desesperaci√≥n agudiza el ingenio

Which is a Spanish saying that translates to something like "desperation sharpens the intelligence". It used to apply for many years but now I think it simply isn't working. Now I think planning is what does the trick.

My best friend and I (remember I don't write names on this blog out of respect for other people's privacy) have talked a lot over this week about what are we going to do in regards to me moving there. We're both on the same page scared of me not finding a job. I'm doing everything I can about it but I definitely know now that desperation won't solve the problem.

At the same time I know the problem will be solved, I just don't know when and the longest it isn't solve the more time I would have wasted on this. I've got other stuff to get done, there are programming books I've got to read, there are programming languages I've got to master, Javascript frameworks I've got to use. I also want to get a grip on Ruby, one of the few languages I haven't given a try yet.

In a nutshell **there is a lot of pending stuff** that is being delayed until I get a job. Because that is the maximum priority.

I haven't even started at my university project or a TMA (tutor-marked assignment) that I've got to send before the 28th of this month.
