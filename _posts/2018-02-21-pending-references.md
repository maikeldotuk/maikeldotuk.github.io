I am working, I am not working, I am not sure....**that isn't good.** 

Theoretically I have a 21 to 24 hours per week job as an administrative support to someone with a dissability. But I have no idea what are the hours that I will be officially working, I have very little idea of when am I paid. I haven't even signed a contract. Yet I'm already counting hours in a time-sheet. 

I need some clarity but I can't have it until I've done the 3 parts of this job. It seems to involve three locations, one is one of the London borough's Town Hall. From there I would do admin duties. Such as proof-reading text that could be too much hassle for my boss, because I am not physically restricted. 

The right description would be a support worker for admin duties. I don't lift my boss from his wheelchair and put him to sleep as a support worker would do, I am instead his hands in front of a PC when he needs stuff to be done quicker or the workload requires it. 

The second location is elsewhere and there I would do payroll tasks as I would be officially working for a payroll company.   
The third location is his home as that's where he has the rest of the paperwork that requires doing. Also some IT tasks and the redoing of the company website, leaflets would be mine. 

It all sounds good described but I want it written on paper. Also the 21 to 24 hours have been only verbally guaranteed for 2 months. That's not enough, not even close. I need a written formal contract stating when will the hours be reduced and what is my working pattern. My rent needs to be paid every month after all, I need to be prepared. I can't be prepared without a date. 

### The other ones

Are one I did yesterday as Meter Reader for A company, and today the same exact job for B company. Two interviews, same job, conditions and client of the agencies. 

They both have no idea I'm applying for them both but, as I said, I am on a first-come first-served basis. I need a guaranteed job now. Not whenever suits them. The quicker one gets the comission. 

Then there are two more. The Aircraft Cleaner job that is so far doing the paperwork (checking references), while the School Caretaker job is not even bothering replying my follow-up emails. In this case I am not going to hide the name, is Tempest Resourcing. They are a dreadful agency that made me go all the way to central London with all my paperwork just to send me back home and fill up my mail inbox of SPAM for other vacancies and DBS checks that I do not have to pay for. Bad recruiters. 

My personal choice would be the admin role. Solely based in the transferable skills it is by far the best. But it doesn't offer any stability and the job so far, it is 21 hours per week yet this week I am already doing less than that. When does the 21 hours per week start?

The meter reader ones have no transferable skills, it's basically a dead-end job that pays the bill but doesn't improve a CV. 

I've pushed today for a written contract. Hopefully I'll get it, I rather be optimistic. 

On the other side, I got a house to clean every week for 40 pounds (3 hours at 12 pounds and hour + tube fare). It is for someone I know well, my ex-roomate when I used to live in Central London. So...that's something I've got guaranteed every week. 

I honestly want to stop jobseeking immediately. I've got a lot to do university-wise.
