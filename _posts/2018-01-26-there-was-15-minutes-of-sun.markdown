This morning there was a bit of sun so I used it by going with a new acquaintance to Warpole Park with a coffee. It's incredibly how much can 15 minutes of sun in your face affect your mood, isn't it?

Today I'm spending most of the day alone, the point was to find or to think what am I going to do next. The time I've got available to find a job is vanishing quickly yet I haven't secured anything yet, which considering how resourceful I usually am is quite shocking. I' got to admit *the degree has me caught by my balls* because I can't never focus on a single task, I still have to make time to study. So I would normally put all my energies in getting the job and sort it in 7 days, but I can't do that now because I also study.

2018 isn't being a nice year so far. It could be so much better.
The job I went to an interview for last Saturday (meaning 6 days ago now) seems to be leading to nothingness, how disappointing.

I've got no leads and no idea of where to carry on next. I haven't planned for an scenario in which I don't actually find a job on time. All that I keep doing is lowering my standards in my jobsearch but there's just so much that I can do it. For example I can't take nothing that is part-time, neither anything that pays minimum wage because the estate agency requirements. This limits me a lot.

Low-pay jobs are easy to find in London, you can get one in 24 hours. But jobs that pay 9, 10 or more pounds an hour require more time and effort. I don't have the time so I'm putting ten times the effort.
