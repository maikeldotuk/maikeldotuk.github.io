So, I haven't written in a while because I have to prepare for the exam of TM354 so postponed the project work until I was past that exam.   
  
Now that I am free I can go back to this project. 

The next step is to build the front-end. By this time I would have written it, tested it and moved onto creating the elastic cloud by code. There has no been time for it so I will have to discard writing it by code and do it using the assistant I'm afraid. It's a trade-off. 

On the good side at work I had a similar project so my Angular knowledge is fresh on my mind. 

## Tasks

1. Create the front-end project "ng new frontend"
2. Push it to github to have it backed-up. 
3. 

## Notes

* Nodemon needs to stop being the runner on "npm start" of the backend. 
* To see the instructions of the backend, it is necesary to put a / (backslash) at the end of the address otherwise is stuck on "loading.."
* I can't do test-driven development in Angular because it requires an in-depth knowledge of the entire framework and there's no time for it. So testing will be done in the browser by the user.
