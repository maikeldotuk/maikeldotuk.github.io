So, I haven't written in a while because I have to prepare for the exam of TM354 so postponed the project work until I was past that exam.   
  
Now that I am free I can go back to this project. 

The next step is to build the front-end. By this time I would have written it, tested it and moved onto creating the elastic cloud by code. There has no been time for it so I will have to discard writing it by code and do it using the assistant I'm afraid. It's a trade-off. 

On the good side at work I had a similar project so my Angular knowledge is fresh on my mind.
