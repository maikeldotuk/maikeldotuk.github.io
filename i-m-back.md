So, I haven't written in a while because I have to prepare for the exam of TM354 so postponed the project work until I was past that exam.

Now that I am free I can go back to this project.

The next step is to build the front-end. By this time I would have written it, tested it and moved onto creating the elastic cloud by code. There has no been time for it so I will have to discard writing it by code and do it using the assistant I'm afraid. It's a trade-off.

On the good side at work I had a similar project so my Angular knowledge is fresh on my mind.

## Tasks

 1. Create the front-end project "ng new frontend"
 2. Push it to github to have it backed-up.
 3. Keep both front-end and back-end running.
 4. Add bootstrap to the project so it doesn't look ugly.
 5. Create the login page.
 6. Create the lists page.
 7. Create and amend job applications.
 8. Find how to integrate finding distances.
 9. Created google API's key.
10. Applied the Google Maps API in the backend to save the distances. 
11. Added the facility to sort by date applied and by distance. 
12. That will  be enough for today, more tomorrow. 

## Notes

* Nodemon needs to stop being the runner on "npm start" of the backend.
* To see the instructions of the backend, it is necesary to put a / (backslash) at the end of the address otherwise is stuck on "loading.."
* I can't do test-driven development in Angular because it requires an in-depth knowledge of the entire framework and there's no time for it. So testing will be done in the browser by the user.
